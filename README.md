**Set up for the collaborating project**

- Use of git personal access token: https://mgimond.github.io/Colby-summer-git-workshop-2021/authenticating-with-github.html#saving-tokens-in-mac
1. Link your github account to Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Rmai0dD30XzL
2. Clone the github repo into Google Drive directory on Colab (in the directory of /drive/MyDrive/): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLhy3_d2UPo   
    1. If just cloning into the default directory, it’ll disappear, and you can’t commit changes made in the notebook.
    2. Recommend using Fine-grained tokens to protect other repositories and account security.
    3. Make sure you’re in the correct directory!
