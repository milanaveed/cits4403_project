# CITS4403 Project
Early set up for the coming project
<br/>
**Set up for the collaboration**

- Use of git personal access token: https://mgimond.github.io/Colby-summer-git-workshop-2021/authenticating-with-github.html#saving-tokens-in-mac
1. Link your github account to Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Rmai0dD30XzL
2. Clone the github repo into Google Drive directory on Colab (in the directory of /drive/MyDrive/): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLhy3_d2UPo   
    1. If just cloning into the default directory, it’ll disappear, and you can’t commit changes made in the notebook.
    2. Recommend using Fine-grained tokens to protect other repositories and account security.
    3. Make sure you’re in the correct directory!

**Report**
# 1. Background [5 marks]
a. Problem statement: describe the situation that you are going to simulate
and analyze.
b. Importance discussion: illustrate the importance of your selected case
study, supported with related literature reference (e.g. published journals
or books).
c. Overview: an overview of the report, including the model you use and the
conclusion you make based on the simulation results.
# 2. Model Description [10 marks]
Demonstrate clear and solid computational modeling thinking, provide a clear
modeling process, including:
a. Explain why your selected type of model is suitable for your chosen case,
supported with related literature reference (e.g. published journals or
books).
b. Clearly and logically demonstrate all the assumptions and rules of your
model;
c. Describe and explain the initial configuration and the parameter choices
for your model.
*Note: Your submitted .ipynb file should contain the corresponding code
implementation of your described model. Detailed code comments should be given
regarding your model details: rules, initial configuration, parameters etc.
# 3. Results [10 marks]
Describe and discuss the simulation results, including:
a. Results visualization and discussion [5 marks]:
● Visualization of the initial configuration and the visualization of the
final simulation results.
● Discuss your findings of the simulation process after experiments,
including any trends and patterns.
b. Different parameter comparison and analysis [5 marks]:
● Compare the simulation results or quantitative values with at least
two sets of different parameter variants of your model, e.g. different
probability, different initial configuration, or any other associated
parameter values of your model.
● Display the visualization results with different parameters, and
discuss the influences of different parameters to your simulation
results.
*Note: Your submitted .ipynb file should contain the corresponding code
implementation and the output of your results visualization. Detailed code comments
should be given regarding the different chosen parameters.
# 4. Conclusion [5 marks]
Summarize the conclusion of your findings based on your simulation results,
discuss the limitations of your model and justify your simulation results with the
real-world phenomenon. Discuss about any future works.
